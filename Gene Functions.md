A Report of the Top 5 Upregulated and Downregulated Genes

Based on the DeSeq analysis of the RNA-seq dataset, below are the identified top upregulated and downregulated genes:

**Top 5 Upregulated Genes**

1.     **EMILIN2:** The Elastin Microfibril interfacer 2 has been predicted to enables extracellular matrix constituent in conferring elasticity. It is indicated to participate in cell adhesion as well.

2.     **POU3FA**: While this gene is not available on GeneCards, it has been reported to encode the POU-domain-containing protein. This protein functions as a transcription factor.

3.     **LOC285854**: This gene ID was not found on the GeneCards database or any other suggested platforms by Google.

4.     **VEPH1:** The Ventricular Zone Expressed PH Domain Containing I gene enables the binding activity of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate. Also, it participates actively in the negative regulation of SMAD protein signal transduction and transforming growth factor receptor signaling pathway.

5.     **DTHD1:** This refers to the Death Domain Containing 1 gene, which encodes a protein that contains the death domain. It is involved in signaling pathways and the development of signaling complexes, including the apoptosis pathway.

**Top 5 Downregulated Genes**

1.     **TBX5:** This is the T-Box Transcription Factor 5, which encodes transcription factors associated with the regulation of developmental processes. Also, it is suspected to play a part in heart development and specification of limb identity.

2.     **IFITM1:** The Inteferon-Induced Transmembrane protein 1 limits cellular entry by several viral pathogens, such as Ebola Virus, Influenza A virus, etc.

3.     **LAMA2:** This refers to the Laminin Subunit Alpha 2, which mediates the attachment, migration, and organization of cells into tissues. This gene is particularly important during embryonic development through its interaction with other extracellular matrix components.

4.     **CAV2:** This protein-coding gene is called the Caveolin 2. It is involved in essential cellular functions, such as cellular growth control, signal transduction, lipid metabolism, and apoptosis. It has been predicted to function as a suppressor of tumors.

5.     **TNN:** Otherwise referred to as Tenascin N, this gene enables integrin binding ability, and it has been predicted to be associated with the generation of neurons, osteoblast differentiation, and many other biological processes.
